Getting Started

- You will need to download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/.

Next, use a package manager to download the packages:

- Yarn: `yarn install`
- Npm: `npm install `
- Pnpm: `pnpm install`

 
If you want the anime and Spotify features to work, you need to edit the `.env.example` file. After editing, rename it as `.env`.

To start in development mode:

- Yarn: `yarn run dev`
- Npm: `npm run dev`
- Pnpm: `pnpm run dev`


To build:

- Yarn: `yarn run build`
- Npm: `npm run build`
- Pnpm: `pnpm run build`

 
Note:
You can't render this website in static mode because it uses Nuxt.JS's server feature.
