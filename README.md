I have been developing myself in the frontend/backend field for almost 3 years and I have made a lot of websites for myself. However, I kept most of them simple, but in this website, I will try different things and share them with you as open-source because people can contribute to this project and benefit from this template.

### üîß Getting Started

- You will need to download Node.js (**Version should be above 16.11**) from https://nodejs.org/en/.

Next, use a package manager to download the packages:

- Yarn: `yarn install`
- Npm: `npm install `
- Pnpm: `pnpm install`

 
If you want the anime and Spotify features to work, you need to edit the `.env.example` file. After editing, rename it as `.env`.

To start in development mode:

- Yarn: `yarn run dev`
- Npm: `npm run dev`
- Pnpm: `pnpm run dev`


To build:

- Yarn: `yarn run build`
